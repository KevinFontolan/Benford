ITERATIONS ON BENFORD'S LAW

Newcomb-Benford's methodology of analyzing the frequency distribution of leading digits in sets and clusters
of real-life numerical data can be used to detect possible frauds in human processes.

As seen in 2009 Iranian elections, 2010 Brazilian elections and 2014 Brazilian elections, public poll results
were starkly divergent from the official numbers released by the government post-election.
Benford's law application on these results reportedly returned a high chance of fraud in all of these elections
by spotting highly divergent first-digit frequency distributions from the predicted ones.

In regards to Brazil, the electronic voting machines currently in use do not provide any form of confirmation
outputs, ballots or prints of any kind. All the voting data is released by a centralized office.

A similar case scenario occurred in 2018 Brazilian general elections, and the purpose of this work is to 
verify and expose possible frauds in the electronic voting machines and/or accounting of votes.


Ps.: In 2018 Brazilian elections, there have been popular efforts in counting the votes via smartphone apps, but
as of its usage and methodology of data gathering, the processes cannot withstand legal analysis or challenges.
Thus, Newcomb-Benford's Law is a solid approach to expose the work of fraudsters, as with a priori justification
and empirical analysis, science stands impaired.
